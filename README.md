# Halloween Pumpkin with Sound and Light Effects
Halloween is close and I wanted to make a related cool project. Of course, it will involve a pumpkin. Also I wanted to add some electronics, of course. For that, inside we have an Arduino connected to a few other parts. For light effects, I’m using an addressable controlled LED strip. For sound we have a mp3 module and to detect movement a PIR sensor. The scary pumpkin will stay powered off till it detects movement. Once it detects that somebody is close, it will run a few random loops such and play scary sounds. Also changing lights colors and blinking. </br> </br>

# Get PCB Prototype
You can easily build the circuit on a breadboard, I also converted the breadboard circuit into a professional prototype. If you want to avoid a complicated circuit, you can get 10 PCBs for just $5 from the link below. All components used are easy to find and solderable. This prototype allows you to control up to 3 pcs LED strips with 3 different sensors (such as IR, PIR and HC-SR04). </br>
