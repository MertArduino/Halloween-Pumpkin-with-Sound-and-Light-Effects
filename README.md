# Halloween Pumpkin with Sound and Light Effects
Halloween is close and I wanted to make a related cool project. Of course, it will involve a pumpkin. Also I wanted to add some electronics, of course. For that, inside we have an Arduino connected to a few other parts. For light effects, I’m using an addressable controlled LED strip. For sound we have a mp3 module and to detect movement a PIR sensor. The scary pumpkin will stay powered off till it detects movement. Once it detects that somebody is close, it will run a few random loops such and play scary sounds. Also changing lights colors and blinking. </br> </br>
